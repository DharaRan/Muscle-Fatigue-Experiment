% Calculates windowed (over- and non-overlapping) RMS of a signal using the specified windowlength
% y = rms(signal, windowlength, overlap, zeropad)
% signal is a 1-D vector
% windowlength is an integer length of the RMS window in samples
% overlap is the number of samples to overlap adjacent windows (enter 0 to use non-overlapping windows)
% zeropad is a flag for zero padding the end of your data...(0 for NO, 1 for YES)
% ex. y=rms(mysignal, 30, 10, 1).  Calculate RMS with window of length 30 samples, overlapped by 10 samples each, and zeropad the last window if necessary
% ex. y=rms(mysignal, 30, 0, 0).  Calculate RMS with window of length 30 samples, no overlapping samples, and do not zeropad the last window
